        Learn how to marinate shrimp for grilling with this easy marinade 
        that makes your shrimp so yummy you don't even need cocktail sauce. 
        Don't let the cayenne pepper scare you — you don't even taste it. 
        My young kids love it. It is also a big hit with company and easy to prepare. 
        I make this with frozen or fresh shrimp and use my indoor electric grill 
        if the weather is not good for outdoor grilling. 
        Try it with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread.
